# Blogs-Repository

This repository consists of all the files required for my blogs so that learning becomes easier.

#### Hrushikesh Kachgunde

I am a Machine learning enthusiasts currently deep diving into ANNs, RNNs, TensorFlow , Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and NLP's.

I write blogs to keep track on my projects so that I know every detail of it and, keep learning new things with sharing the knowledge I gain in the process to everyone.
